# Sign-Language-Translator


EXPLANATION:

Capture Video: Use OpenCV to capture video frames from the webcam. This involves initializing the webcam and continuously grabbing frames.

Hand Gesture Detection: Implement a hand gesture detection algorithm to identify hand gestures in each frame. This can be done using deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on hand gesture datasets or techniques like background subtraction, contour detection, or skin color segmentation.

Alphabet Recognition: If you're focusing on translating sign language alphabet letters, you'll need a model to recognize these letters from hand gestures. You can train a custom model using datasets of sign language alphabet gestures or use pre-trained models.

Translation: Once you detect the alphabet letters from hand gestures, translate them into text or speech. This could involve mapping each detected letter to its corresponding alphabet letter or word.

Display: Display the recognized letters or translated text/speech on the screen or as audio output.


SET-UP:
1. Install all Python dependencies == pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Navigate into `src` == cd src


3. Launch the script for a sign language translator == python step_5_camera.py
